# Customer-Churn-Analysis

# Project Overview

Customer churn is when customers stop doing business with a company. In this project, I analyzed customer data to identify
patterns and predict churn using data analytics techniques.
The goal was to provide insights that help businesses improve customer retention.

# Tools & Libraries

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook: For analysis and visualization
